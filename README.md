# The 25 Days of Christmas

Ho, ho, ho!

This is a simple implementation for the challenges at
https://adventofcode.com/2018. Enjoy!

## Details

Each solution was created via `cargo init day_NN --vcs none`, and
(usually) have an independent `src/part1.rs` and `src/part2.rs`, so you
can easily see what was changed to finish the second half.

I focused on a balance between code-readibility and writing speed: I
want to get these done quickly, but I also want to come back at some
point and figure out what I did.
